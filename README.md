# wwdc21-CellularAutomaton
My WWDC21 Swift Student Challenge project is about cellular automata and specifically the one-dimensional cellular automaton.

This playground contains a brief explaination about 1D cellular automata and the ability to look at different rules and their Wolfram classes. This is explained in the playground. :sparkles:

## Usage
* Download the zip archive the repository (**SSC-ViggoOveres.zip**). There is also the playground folder available in the repository to view the code from Github. :octocat:
* Open CellularAutomaton.playground, macOS is recommended.
* You can read the explanation about the 1D cellular automata and the Wolfram classes. At the end of the file you can change some parameters and look at different rules displayed in the liveView. :tada:
